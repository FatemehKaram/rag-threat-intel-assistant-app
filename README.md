# Threat Intelligence Assistant

A powerful tool that helps users quickly understand whether an IP address, domain, or file hash is potentially dangerous. The Threat Intelligence Assistant automatically gathers data from trusted sources and provides clear, actionable threat reports in seconds.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multi-Indicator Analysis**: Analyze IP addresses, domains, and file hashes for potential threats
- **Trusted Data Sources**: Automatically pulls data from reliable sources including:
  - AlienVault OTX (Open Threat Exchange)
  - AbuseIPDB
  - Additional threat intelligence feeds
- **RAG-Powered Intelligence**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to synthesize the most relevant threat information
- **Plain-Language Reports**: Generates easy-to-understand summaries explaining threat activities
- **Risk Assessment**: ML-powered risk rating system (Low, Medium, High) to help with decision-making
- **Source Verification**: Provides links to original data sources for verification
- **Fast Results**: Delivers comprehensive threat reports in seconds
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive web application

## 🚀 What It Does

The Threat Intelligence Assistant helps security professionals and IT teams:

- **Identify Threat Types**: Quickly determine if an indicator is linked to:
  - Brute-force attacks
  - Malware distribution
  - Spam campaigns
  - Botnet activity
  - Other malicious behaviors

- **Make Informed Decisions**: Get clear risk assessments to decide whether to:
  - Block the threat immediately
  - Monitor for further activity
  - Investigate further

- **Save Time**: Get comprehensive threat intelligence without manually checking multiple sources

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python-based threat intelligence processing
- **Data Sources**: AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, and other trusted feeds
- **AI/ML**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for intelligent data synthesis
- **Risk Assessment**: Machine learning model for automated threat scoring
- **Frontend**: User-friendly web interface
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for real-time threat data retrieval

## 📋 Use Cases

- **Security Operations Centers (SOC)**: Rapid threat assessment and triage
- **Incident Response**: Quick analysis of suspicious indicators during security incidents
- **Network Security**: Proactive monitoring of network traffic and connections
- **Threat Hunting**: Investigation of potential security threats
- **Compliance**: Documentation of threat intelligence for security audits

## 🔍 Example Output

When analyzing a suspicious IP address, the tool might return:

```
Risk Level: HIGH
Threat Type: Brute-force attacks, Malware distribution
Summary: This IP address has been associated with multiple brute-force login attempts 
against SSH and RDP services, as well as serving malware payloads. The activity 
has been observed across multiple geographic regions over the past 30 days.

Recommendation: Block immediately and investigate any systems that may have 
communicated with this IP.
